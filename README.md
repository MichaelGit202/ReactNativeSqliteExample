# How to Make a React Native-SQLite Project for Android

## 🎯 Goal  
Create a React Native app that interfaces with a SQLite database.

## 🛠️ Tools  
- React (the library)  
- Android Studio  

## ✅ Prerequisites  
- You know how to create a React Native project  
- Android Studio is already installed  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
There are many hardware dependencies and extra steps you might encounter to get a project like this working. It’s slightly more complicated than just downloading Node and running your app. You should create your own project and use my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MichaelGit202/React-Presentation) as a reference.
